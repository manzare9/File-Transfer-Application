# File-Transfer-Application
File Transfer Application:
I have done this application in both java and C++.
A simple file transfer has been made in which a client firstly upload the file on server and then request the server for files in this way the server transfers the file and put the file in the default application directory.
In the both codes there are libraries and API calls are imported and used in such a way that the 
Socket programming is done in a nicely manner.
The java server runs on a port 55555 and C++ runs on 55556 port with own IP as 127.0.0.1.
